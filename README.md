## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file for custom settings:
```env
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
MAX_ARTICLES=5
SUMMARY_LENGTH=150
```

### Model Configuration
Customize the summarization model in `config.py`:
```python
SUMMARIZER_MODEL = "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6"
MAX_SUMMARY_LENGTH = 200
MIN_SUMMARY_LENGTH = 50
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Custom Search Parameters
- **Number of articles:** Configurable (default: 3)
- **Summary length:** Adjustable based on needs
- **Source filtering:** Exclude specific domains
- **Language support:** Multi-language article processing

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching:** Frequently searched topics cached for speed
- **Parallel processing:** Multi-threaded article fetching
- **Memory management:** Efficient handling of large articles

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- **No data collection:** Searches are not stored or tracked
- **Local processing:** All AI operations run locally
- **HTTPS support:** Secure connections for web scraping
- **Rate limiting:** Prevents abuse of external APIs

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**❌ Model download taking too long**
→ The first run downloads the DistilBART model (~1GB). This is normal and only happens once.

**❌ "No articles found" error**
→ Try rephrasing your query or check your internet connection.

**❌ Memory errors during summarization**
→ Reduce `MAX_SUMMARY_LENGTH` in config or ensure sufficient RAM.

**❌ Flask server not starting**
→ Ensure port 5000 is not in use: `lsof -i :5000` (macOS/Linux)

### Performance Tips:
- Use specific, focused queries for better results
- Avoid overly broad topics that might return irrelevant content
- Clear browser cache if experiencing loading issues

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- **🔎 Keyword Highlighting** - Highlight important terms in summaries
- **📈 Search History** - Store and revisit previous research
- **🎙️ Voice Input** - Hands-free searching with speech recognition
- **🌍 Multilingual Support** - Research in multiple languages
- **💾 Export Options** - Save summaries as PDF, Word, or text files
- **📊 Source Analytics** - Show credibility scores for sources
- **🔗 Citation Generator** - Automatic citation formatting
- **📱 Mobile App** - Native iOS/Android applications
